# Counters
Simple iOS application to gain more exposure to Swift. Design consists of two views:
* Main View: shows all the counters, with the labels and values. also allows to add a new counter and delete an existing counter.
* Detail View: allows the user to edit the count of the specific counter, by adding by 1, subtracting by 1, or resetting to 0
